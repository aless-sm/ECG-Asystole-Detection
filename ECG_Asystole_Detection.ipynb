    "There are major differences between the raw and filtered signals now. Since the raw signal fourier transform has an extreme dominant frequency at 0 Hz that dwarfs other frequencies, the raw and filtered fourier transformations are plotted above on a logarithmic scale for better visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bandpass filter was specifically designed to remove low frequency noise below 5 Hz and high frequency noise above 50 Hz. Below 5 Hz, we see that the dominant 0 Hz frequency has been drastically attenuated (reduced). This noise was predominantly caused by baseline wander, a deviation from the signal baseline due to respiration or movement (Kumar et al, 2018). Before filtering, this frequency had a magnitude of over $10^7$. After filtering, this frequency's magnitude was reduced to about $10^3$. This noise is now 10,000 times weaker in the filtered signal than it was in the raw signal. \n",

    "The filtered signal frequency band starts to match the raw signal frequency band between 5 Hz and 50 Hz, which is our desired result. This range should have our physiological data of interest. For example, the P wave typically corresponds to frequencies of 5-30 Hz, and the QRS wave corresponds to frequencies of 8-50 Hz (Tereeshchenko & Josephson, 2016). The strength of those frequencies are preserved.\n",

    "Between 40 and 60 Hz we see the filtered signal begin to diminish in strength as it moves towards the high frequency cut off of 50 Hz. Above 50 Hz we see strong attenuation of the frequencies, with magnitudes that were previously around $10^3$ and $10^4$ dropping to $10^2$. This effectively removes high frequency noise that can be attributed to powerline interference and myoelectric contraction (Bahaz & Benzid, 2018). This cutoff frequency also removes the noise above 100 Hz, which can be caused by cable/electrode movement or high frequency muscle activity (Fariha Mohd Apandi et al, 2020).\n",
